Project 2: Kindle database remake?

Online reading application that stores these books in a *'library'* inside of a **users** account


User stories:

-Users have a library of books that they can add to or remove from

-Users can set a book from their library as active, being the current book they have selected

-The app remembers the last page the users left of on (for each book in the users library)

-The reading application displays a page at a time???
